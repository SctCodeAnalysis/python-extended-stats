Assumptions:
— The depth 0f 6 in a project filetree shows it's flatness 
— This project has a large object-oriented architecture based on 304 classes and 1459 methods 
— Considering the CBO metric we can state that there are some classes preferable to be rewrote
— Due to a lack of typing and docstring the project support may be truly challenging
— We can also notice there are very few classes inherited by any others - this may signify that there is very poor abctraction level
— 14 pass keywords state there is some fork to do in advance
— However the average cyclomatic complecity looks really fine as for such a massive repo
— The number of unused elements seem suspecious so somebosy needs to inspect the issue
